I was born in 1998 in Orvieto, Umbria, Italy and I earned a Bachelor's degree in Physics (July, 2022) at the
University of Perugia, where I started developing an interest in quantum computing while working on the definition of 
Quantum Blockchains based on Temporal Correlation for the thesis. I obtained a Master's degree in Data Science with
honors in 2024 from Sapienza University of Rome. In my thesis I explored early exit techniques for quantum machine 
learning algorithms as a method for noise mitigation.
I am currently a PhD student in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at DIET department, working on quantum computing and 
quantum machine learning.

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
